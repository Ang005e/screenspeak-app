ScreenSpeak

ScreenSpeak is an application designed to locate text anywhere, in any application. It's simple to use - press the SEARCH hotkey (Shift-Alt-S) and a searchbar will appear at the top of your screen! Type in some text, press Enter, wait for a moment, and if ScreenSpeak finds any similar text it will highlight its location on the screen! 

TODO:

- add "escape" function to remove screen highlighting
- add "track" function to track highlighting onto scrolling motion
- implement dictation to read out searched text
- complete unit tests
- fix highlighting offset
- notify user if no text is found
- add loading indicator while searching
- reduce application footprint 
- optimise application
