**ScreenSpeak**
ScreenSpeak is an application designed to locate text anywhere, in any application. It's simple to use - press the SEARCH hotkey (Shift-Alt-S) and a searchbar will appear at the top of your screen! Type in some text, press Enter, wait for a moment, and if ScreenSpeak finds any similar text it will highlight its location on the screen! 

**Running the application**
1. Open the root folder in command prompt
2. Double click the "runapp.bat" file

Alternately, open the root folder in Visual Studio Code and run "program.py"


**TODO**

*Urgent*
- fix highlighting offset
- add "escape" function to remove screen highlighting
- notify user if no text is found

*Prioritory*
- complete unit tests
- implement TTS to narrate matched text
- create external download link for new builds
- set up GitHub CD workflow
  
*Future*
- add "track" function to track highlighting onto scrolling motion
- add loading indicator while searching
- reduce application footprint 
- optimise application
- transfer core functions to C# or CPP and create API
